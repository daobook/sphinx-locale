"Usage is simple: whenever Sphinx encounters a cross-reference that has no"
" matching target in the current documentation set, it looks for targets "
"in the documentation sets configured in :confval:`intersphinx_mapping`.  "
"A reference like ``:py:class:`zipfile.ZipFile``` can then link to the "
"Python documentation for the ZipFile class, without you having to specify"
" where it is located exactly."

"When using the \"new\" format (see below), you can even force lookup in a"
