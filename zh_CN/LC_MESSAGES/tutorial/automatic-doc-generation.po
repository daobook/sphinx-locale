"In the :ref:`previous section <tutorial-describing-objects>` of the "
"tutorial you manually documented a Python function in Sphinx. However, "
"the description was out of sync with the code itself, since the function "
"signature was not the same. Besides, it would be nice to reuse `Python "
"docstrings <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#what-"
"is-a-docstring>`_ in the documentation, rather than having to write the "
"information in two places."
